# Renewal Risk Radar

**FastAPI project that analyzes customer usage and support signals to predict renewal risk and recommend GTM actions.**

Renewal Risk Radar ingests account-level product usage, support tickets, and customer notes, then produces:
- A **renewal risk score** (0â€“100) with top risk drivers and supporting evidence
- **Expansion opportunities** inferred from usage patterns
- A prioritized **playbook** of recommended actions
- Ready-to-use internal Slack and customer email drafts

## ðŸš€ Tech Stack
- **FastAPI** for API routes
- **Pydantic v2** for request/response validation
- **SQLite** (planned) for persistence and caching
- **Ruff** + **Black** + **pre-commit** for linting and formatting

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
```

## ðŸ›  Setup
1. **Clone the repo**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd renewal-risk-radar
   ```
2. **Create a virtual environment and install dependencies**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install pre-commit && pre-commit install
   ```
3. **Run tests**
   ```bash
   make test
   ```
4. **Start the dev server**
   ```bash
   make run
   ```
   Visit `http://localhost:8000/docs` for interactive API docs.

## ðŸ“¡ Example Usage
**Health check**
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8000/healthz
# {"status": "ok"}
```

**(Planned in Phase 2)** Scoring an account with sample data:
```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/score \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"account_id":"ACME_CORP"}'
```

## ðŸ“… Development Phases
- **Phase 1 (âœ…)** Scaffold project, `/healthz` route, tests, tooling
- **Phase 2** Implement `/score`, ingest sample data, return hardcoded but schema-valid JSON
- **Phase 3** Integrate LLM with strict JSON output + validation/repair pass
- **Phase 4** Add persistence, caching, and metrics
- **Phase 5** Lightweight evals + reporting
- **Phase 6** Deploy (Render/Railway) + optional Slack/CRM integrations

**Status:** In active development â€” currently private, will be made public after polish.
